Kelly Jones - README

## Getting Started
You're here.  You're already started.  If you're looking for code samples of my work, please note that I have moved all of my projects to private repositories in Bitbucket.  

"Why?", you may ask.  Well, it's complicated.  But I have developed a few applications that I have chosen to not release as open source.
If you are looking for code samples, ping me.  I'm happy to allow access to my Bitbucket repos.

### Prerequisites
A curiosity as to whether or not I have any projects on GitHub.

### Installing
Nothing to install since my projects have moved to Bitbucket.

## Running the tests
Oh, tests. Right.
